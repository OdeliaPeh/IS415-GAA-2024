In this exercise, we learn how to plot and visualize choropleth maps using an R package called \*\*tmap\*\* package.

## Installing and loading R packages

The packages that are used in this hands on exercise are:

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/)

-   [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) for importing delimited text file

-   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for tidying data

-   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for wrangling data

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) for handling geospatial data

We use the following to install and load the packages in Rstudio:

```{r}
#| eval: false
pacman::p_load(sf, tmap, tidyverse)
```

(Note that readr, tidyr and dplyr are part of tidyverse package)
