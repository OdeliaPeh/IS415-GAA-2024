# Overview

Spatial Point Pattern Analysis is the evaluation of the pattern or distribution, of a set of points on a surface. Using appropriate functions of **spatstat**, we can discover the spatial point processes of childecare centres in Singapore.

The specific questions we would like to answer in this exercise are as follows:

-   are the childcare centres in Singapore randomly distributed throughout the country?

-   if the answer is not, then the next logical question is where are the locations with higher concentration of childcare centres?

## Installing and loading R packages

The packages that are used in this hands on exercise are:

-   [**sf**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/) for handling geospatial data

-   [**spatstat**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spatstat/) which will be used to perform 1st and 2nd order spatial point pattern analysis

-   [**raster**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raster/) which reads, writes, manipulates, analyses and model of gridded spatial data (i.e.Â raster). In this hands-on exercise, it will be used to convert image output generate by **spatstat** into raster format.

```
-   [**maptools**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maptools/) provides a set of tools for manipulating geographic data. In this hands-on exercise, we mainly use it to convert *Spatial* objects into *ppp* format of **spatstat**.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/) which provides functions for plotting cartographic quality static point patterns maps or interactive maps by using [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) API

We use the following to install and load the packages in Rstudio:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(maptools, sf, raster, spatstat, tmap)
```

## Datasets used

In this exercise, three data sets will be used. They are:

-   `CHILDCARE`, from data.gov.sg in the geojson format.

-   `MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL`, from data.gov.sg in the ESRI shapefile format

-   `CostalOutline`, a polygon feature data showing the national boundary of Singapore. For this one, we are encouraged to use the appropriate **sf** functions to derive this dataset
