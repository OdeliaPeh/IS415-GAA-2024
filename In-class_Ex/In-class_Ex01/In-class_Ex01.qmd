title: "In-class Exercise 1"

execute:
  warning: false
date-modified: "last-modified"

While there was no in-class exercise for week 1, I do want to record that Prof Kam explained to me a different way to display the modified date.

Instead of 
```{r}
#| eval: false
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
```

We should use
```{r}
#| eval: false
date-modified: "last-modified"
```
