# Overview

I will be working on and build the prototype Shiny app module that displays the [**geographic segmentation**]{.underline} of various facilities that are relevant to eldercare. These include:

-   Eldercare Services

-   Community Gardens

-   Parks

-   Hospitals

-   Community Centres (CCs)

-   CHAS clinics

# R Packages

First, I will load the necessary R packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

# Data import and wrangling
